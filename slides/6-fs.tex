  \frametitle{File System}
  \begin{block}{Challenges}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item How to store very large amount of data?
      \item How to store it after {\emph the} process has been killed?
      \item How to allow multiple processes to access it concurrently?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{File System}
  \begin{block}{Two operations}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item read\_block(block\_number)
      \item write\_block(block\_number)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block} \pause
  \begin{block}{How to, with these two, ..}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Find information?
      \item Keep a user from reading another user's data?
      \item Know which blocks are free?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{File Abstraction}
  OSes abstract processor into process, physical memory into virtual address space and file system into files. \\
  Processes (Threads), address space and files are the three most important abstractions that an Operation System offers.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{File Naming}
  \begin{block}{Naming rules}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Different rules for different OS.
      \item Names length varies from 1 to 255 characters.
      \item Case-sensitive (UNIX), or not (MS-DOS).
      \item Extension consideration.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Files Structure}
  \begin{block}{File Structure}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Unstructured sequence of byte (any meaning is imposed by the user procces). Offers the maximum flexibility.\footnote{UNIX, MS-DOS, Windows}
      \item Fixed length-records each with internal structure (80 characters records, 132 char for line printer).\footnote{Not used anymore}
      \item Tree records, each files has a key value, tree sorted according to these values.\footnote{Still used in some commercial data processing}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Files Types}
  \begin{block}{File Types}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Regular files (ASCII or binary files).
      \item Names length varies from 1 to 255 characters.
      \item Case-sensitive (UNIX), or not (MS-DOS).
      \item Extension consideration.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Binary File Example}
  \begin{block}{Executable binary example:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item header,
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Magic-number (identifying the file as executable),
          \item Size of the various pieces of the file,
          \item Address at which execution starts
          \item Various flags.
      \end{itemize}
      \item text,
      \item data,
      \item relocation bits,
      \item symbol table (for debugging purposes).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Binary File Example}
  \begin{block}{Archive example (collection of library procedures compiled but not linked):}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item header (telling its name),
      \item Creation date,
      \item Owner,
      \item Protection code,
      \item Size.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Files Extension and OS}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item An OS must at least recognize its own executable file type (they usually recognized more than this one type),
      \item TOPS-20 checked the creation date of executable file, sought for its source file, and recompile it if the source file was updated.
      \item \emph{make} program reproduce this behavior, file extensions are mandatory.
      \item Strong mandatory file extensions make an OS unusable (e.g., all extension file output produced are ".dat" -- impossible to copy a file!)
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{File Access}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Sequential access: files were read from the beginning to the end (magnetic tape).
      \item Random access files: files can be read in any order. To choose the position in the file and read you can:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Give the position as a parameter at teach read operation,
          \item Seek at a specific position and then sequentially read (UNIX and Windows).
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{File Attributes (Metadata)}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Right: who and how can the file be accessed.
      \item Password: required to access the file.
      \item Creator: ID of the user who created the file.
      \item Owner: ID of the user who owns the file.
      \item Read-only flag.
      \item Hidden flag.
      \item System flag.
      \item Archive flag (set by the system when changed, cleared by the back-up program).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{File Attributes (Metadata)}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item ASCII/binary flag: 0 for ASCII file, 1 for binary file.
      \item Random access flag: 0 for sequential access only, 1 for random access.
      \item Temporary flag: 0 for normal, 1 for delete file on process exit
      \item Lock flag: 0 for unlocked, nonzero for locked.
      \item Creation time.
      \item Time of last access.
      \item Time of last change.
      \item Current size.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{File Operations}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Create: while no data are put into, the file is announced and some of its attributes are set.
      \item Delete: frees up some disk space (sys-call).
      \item Open: the system fetchs attributes and list of disk addresses into main memory for rapid access later on.
      \item Close: frees up internal table space. Some OS impose a maximum number of open files.
      \item Read: the user must specify how many data are expected and a buffer to put them in.
      \item Write: data are written. If position is the end of the file, the file size increases, if it is in the middle, existing data are overwritten.
      \item Append: write-like but only at the end of the file.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{File Operations}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Seek: for random access files, set the file pointer at the requested position.
      \item Get attributes: many programs need it, i.e.\emph{make}.
      \item Set attributes: allows the user to modify some of the file attributes.
      \item Rename: simple as that.
    \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Directories}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Single-level directory system: only \textbf{one} folder (digital cameras, music players, first PCs).
      \item Hierarchical directory system.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Path Names}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Absolute (from \textbf{root} directory): \\ \emph{/etc/apt/source.list}, \emph{/var/log/messages}.
      \item Relative (from \textbf{current} directory):
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Implicit: \emph{Download/Gramatik.zip}, \emph{../Movies/}.
          \item Explicit: \emph{./Download/Gramatik.zip}, \emph{./../Movies/}.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    What are dot and dotdot?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Directory Operation}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Create: creates a directory with dot and dotdot.
      \item Delete: deletes a directory (only empty directories can be deleted).
      \item Opendir: opens a directory so it can read.
      \item Readdir: reading a directory allows to list all files within it.
      \item Closedir: frees up internal table space.
      \item Rename: simple as that.
      \item Link: (hard link) increments the file's i-node counter and allows to make the file appear in different directories.
      \item Unlink: decrements the file's i-node counter. If it is zero the file is delete from the system, otherwise only the path name specified is removed (UNIX system call to delete a file is unlink).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{File System Layout}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Sector 0 contains the MBR\footnote{Master Boot Record}, used to boot the computer, at the end of the MBR is the partition table.
      \item Partition table contains starting and ending disk addresses of the different partitions. One is marked as active.
      \item At boot time, the BIOS reads and executes the MBR, the MBR program locates the active partition, reads its first block (boot block) and execute it.
      \item The boot block loads the OS contained in that partition.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item All partition contains a boot block, even if it does not contain a bootable OS.
        \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Partition System Layout}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Boot block: cf previous slide.
      \item Superblock: details include a magic number to identify the file system type and the number of blocks in the file system.
      \item Free space management: can be in a form of a list of pointers.
      \item I-nodes: array of data structure, one per file.
      \item Root directory: contains the top of the system tree.
      \item Files and directories: remainder of the disk.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Contiguous allocation,
      \item Linked List allocation.
  \end{itemize}
